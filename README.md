# Landing Page Project

## Table of Contents

This project focuses on the basics of Java Script Such as functions, loops and Event listener .
And it uses the property of manipulating DOM.
And with it through Java Script I made a function to distinguish the active section that I am reading now.
And I also made a function to make me move between sections when I press it smoothly.
